Hints
1) What is the web inspector in web browsers?

**Inspection**

\* This problem will be done in Firefox, however any modern browser should be able to complete the task at hand. Some modifications of the steps will be necessary, but the general premise is the same.

Inspect element shows the client-side code shown for a web page. You can access it by pressing F12 on your keyboard, or clicking on View Page Source under the right click menu. You will first see the HTML code in the Inspector tab.

Going through the HTML code you can see a comment. Comments in HTML look like \<!--COMMENT-->. This comment contains your flag: picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_b6602e8e}!
