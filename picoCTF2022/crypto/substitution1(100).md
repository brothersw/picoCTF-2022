A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again. Download the message here.

Hints
1) Try a frequency attack
2) Do the punctuation and the individual words help you make any substitutions?

**Solve**

This problem is extremely similar to the [previous problem](./crypto/substitution0(100).md) Please see this problem first.
Here is the challenge

The website I used to solve the last problem returns:

```
CTFs (short for capture the flag) are a type of computer security competition. Contestants are presented with a set of challenges which test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories, and when solved, each yields a string (called a flag) which is submitted to an online scoring service. CTFs are a great way to learn a wide array of computer security skills in a safe, legal environment, and are hosted and played by many security groups around the world for fun and practice. For this problem, the flag is: picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_E57444AC}
```

This already looks great, however the flag doesn't work correctly as a submission yet.
picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_E57444AC}
The spelling of frequency is off as frejuency. This is because the letter q isn't used in the decoed passage anywhere except in the flag
picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_E57444AC}
