## Description

If it swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, but talks like a goose, what is it?

## First look

This challenge is a keygen from a binary file. When looking at the binary, something is strange with main. It is filled with hex that doesn't represent assembly, although the entry function from libcstartmain calls it just fine, and the program execute just fine. We need to figure out why main executes. To start, I looked for references to main within the program and found something at offset ``0x1100``

## What is going on here?

This program seems to do something interesting, and modify the actual assembly within the program. It loads a ponter as the position of the main function, xors the bytes at the pointer with 1, increments the pointer, and then jumps up to the xor instruction if the pointer isn't at a certain line yet . This loops though all bytes of main, xoring it with 1 until the end of main.

```C
void deobfuscate(){
	for(int ptr = main; ptr != endOfMain + 1; ptr ++){
	  *ptr = *ptr ^ 1
	}
}
```

## Deobfuscating and Patching the binary

It is pretty simple to reverse this process, and there are quite a few ways to do this. I chose to use vim as a hex editor using the command ``%!xxd`` and a quick python script. I read the bytes of main from ``0x1160`` to ``0x125f`` and fed it into my python program which xored the input with 1 and gave me hex back out. I then patched the binary to have the deobfuscated contents of main here, and placed the hex ``c3`` at ``0x1104``, effectively bypassing the deobfuscate function by placing a return statement at the front of it. This left me to reverse enginer the contents of main.
Here are the original bytes for main:

## Solving in gdb

Here is the deobfuscated code for main:

The main code is relatively simple. It takes some input, loads some values into memory, and then loops over input checking the input character by character against an xor of two registers. These two registers get updated every loop by the next byte in memory. If one of these checks fail, a register gets set to true, and when the loop completes a fail message gets sent. If this register is never set to 1, remaining as 0, it will instead print a success message on your flag.

The way I solved this was by setting a break point in gdb at ``0x1205``, the instruction right after the xor operation between the two registers. Pwndbg helps; however, it isn't necessary. Start the program with ``r``, and check the result of the xor operation every iteration of the loop. Each value will correspond with the ASCII value for each character of the flag. Once you have done this you will have the flag! Check it again locally to make sure that you didn't make any mistakes and submit!
