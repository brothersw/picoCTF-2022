Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row. Connect to the program with netcat: $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50305 The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.

Hints
1) How does the program check if you won?

**Solve**

Lets look at the program source provided

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>


#define WAIT 60



static const char* flag = "[REDACTED]";

char* hands[3] = {"rock", "paper", "scissors"};
char* loses[3] = {"paper", "scissors", "rock"};
int wins = 0;



int tgetinput(char *input, unsigned int l)
{
    fd_set          input_set;
    struct timeval  timeout;
    int             ready_for_reading = 0;
    int             read_bytes = 0;
    
    if( l <= 0 )
    {
      printf("'l' for tgetinput must be greater than 0\n");
      return -2;
    }
    
    
    /* Empty the FD Set */
    FD_ZERO(&input_set );
    /* Listen to the input descriptor */
    FD_SET(STDIN_FILENO, &input_set);

    /* Waiting for some seconds */
    timeout.tv_sec = WAIT;    // WAIT seconds
    timeout.tv_usec = 0;    // 0 milliseconds

    /* Listening for input stream for any activity */
    ready_for_reading = select(1, &input_set, NULL, NULL, &timeout);
    /* Here, first parameter is number of FDs in the set, 
     * second is our FD set for reading,
     * third is the FD set in which any write activity needs to updated,
     * which is not required in this case. 
     * Fourth is timeout
     */

    if (ready_for_reading == -1) {
        /* Some error has occured in input */
        printf("Unable to read your input\n");
        return -1;
    } 

    if (ready_for_reading) {
        read_bytes = read(0, input, l-1);
        if(input[read_bytes-1]=='\n'){
        --read_bytes;
        input[read_bytes]='\0';
        }
        if(read_bytes==0){
            printf("No data given.\n");
            return -4;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    } else {
        printf("Timed out waiting for user input. Press Ctrl-C to disconnect\n");
        return -3;
    }

    return 0;
}


bool play () {
  char player_turn[100];
  srand(time(0));
  int r;

  printf("Please make your selection (rock/paper/scissors):\n");
  r = tgetinput(player_turn, 100);
  // Timeout on user input
  if(r == -3)
  {
    printf("Goodbye!\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  int computer_turn = rand() % 3;
  printf("You played: %s\n", player_turn);
  printf("The computer played: %s\n", hands[computer_turn]);

  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
  } else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
  }
}


int main () {
  char input[3] = {'\0'};
  int command;
  int r;

  puts("Welcome challenger to the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors");
  puts("For anyone that beats me 5 times in a row, I will offer up a flag I found");
  puts("Are you ready?");
  
  while (true) {
    puts("Type '1' to play a game");
    puts("Type '2' to exit the program");
    r = tgetinput(input, 3);
    // Timeout on user input
    if(r == -3)
    {
      printf("Goodbye!\n");
      exit(0);
    }
    
    if ((command = strtol(input, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
      puts("Please put in a valid number");
      
    } else if (command == 1) {
      printf("\n\n");
      if (play()) {
        wins++;
      } else {
        wins = 0;
      }

      if (wins >= 5) {
        puts("Congrats, here's the flag!");
        puts(flag);
      }
    } else if (command == 2) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      puts("Please type either 1 or 2");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This looks intimidating, but all we care about is where it checks the lose/win condition

Lets look for where the program looks to see if you lost 
It checks this here:

```C
  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
```

It seems to preform the C command strstr on your input, and whatever causes the computer to lose on their turn

Lets find what strstr does

You can type ```man strstr```

We see that it:

```
NAME
       strstr, strcasestr - locate a substring

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle);
```

So, this isn't just any check to see if the input == what causes the computer to lose
It looks through the entire string for any part of the string that has what causes the computer to loose within it

We can exploit this by having our input mirror all of the ways that the computer can lose

If we enter ```rockpaperscissors``` into the game, it will always let the player win

Now, lets try it on the server to get our flag

```nc saturn.picoctf.net 50305```

Enter our input the 5 times required to get the win

We get our flag!
It is: ```picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_D80B11AA}```
